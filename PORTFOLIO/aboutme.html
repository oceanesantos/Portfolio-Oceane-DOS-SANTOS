            i have 20 and and I study Web design and visual communication at ICAN DESIGN in Paris.
            Since I finished high school i studied Human Ressources, administration and management.

            During this two years left I understand that I wanted to made more creative thing. 
            I really wanted to create and learn adobes' softwares. 

            During my studies in management, I was able to learn how to structure my work, 
            which today gives me rigor in my productions.
            
            Right now i want to be a graphic designer 
            and this is my first portfolio of what i create during my bachelor.

            Now i aspire to perfect my skills and improve myself.

            I wish you a good portfolio tour ;)
